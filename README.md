Searchspot
===========

One happening day I found myself browsing ikeas website for cheap furniture. Irritated by having to continuosly click on the search bar, and surprised to find that there is no hotkey that does this, I made Searchspot. A hotkey which automatically selects the current web pages search bar.

##Download
(Safari)[https://github.com/zayaankhatib/searchspot/blob/master/Safari/searchspot.safariextz?raw=true]
Chrome - working on it.

##Known Issues

* Not every website will work, if you find a website that doesn't work, raise a github issue or send me an email and i'll see if I can fix it.

* SearchSpot can only locate search bars that are already visible on the page. So if there's a website which has a hidden search bar that appears via a button, searchspot won't find it.
