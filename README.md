##Known Issues

* Not every website will work, if you find a website that doesn't work, raise a github issue or send me an email and i'll see if I can fix it.

* SearchSpot can only locate search bars that are already visible on the page. So if there's a website which has a hidden search bar that appears via a button, searchspot won't find it.
