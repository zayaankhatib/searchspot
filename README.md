SearchSpot
===========

One happening day I found myself exploring ikeas website for cheap furniture. Irritated by having to continuosly click on the search bar, then jump back to the keyboard, I created Searchspot. A hotkey which automatically selects the current web pages search bar. 

##Known Issues

* Not every website will work, if your favourite website work with SearchSpot, raise a github issue or send me an email.

* Right now, SearchSpot is Safari only. Fear not, I'm working on the Chrome version.

* SearchSpot can only locate search bars that are already visible on the page. So if there's a website which has a hidden search bar that is appears via a button, searchspot won't find it
